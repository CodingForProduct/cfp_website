# Coding For Product

Summer 2017 coding workshop presented by Philosophie and Women Who Code.

Philosophie will be holding a series of five workshops where we guide small teams
of intermediate-beginner female coders to create a web application about public
transit. The workshops are aimed at self-driven learners who have have basic
programming knowledge, and want to gain experience in a collaborative development
environment.

The workshops will be held June/July on Sundays from 1pm to 5 pm at Philosophie's
Santa Monica office.

## More Details

Unlike other coding programs that just focus on coding, we will cover product,
design, and development. Each week will start with 4 hours of lectures at
Philosophie. During the rest of the week, the teams will implement some of the
ideas from lectures into their project. Each person is expected to spend 12
hours a week working on the project. (4 hours of lectures , 8 hours of
self-guided learning + programming with team members).

For weeks 2-4, teams will do a short demo of their project to show what they
have accomplished during the past week. In week 5, the teams will do a full
presentation of their app.
